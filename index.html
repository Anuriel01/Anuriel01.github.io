        <h3 class="post-title">Lenovo ideapad flex 5</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Yesterday i got my new laptop, a lenovo ideapad flex 5.
            this laptop have 2 in 1, that means the laptop is a computer and a laptop too.
          you can rotate the screen 360 degrees!.
          <br>
          Lets talk a little about the specs of this amazing laptop.
          It have an i7 intel chip 10th GEN.
          a 16 GB of RAM and a 512 GB ssd card.
          basically you can call it a gaming pc.
          </p>
          <p>
            the lenovo ideapad flex 5 support 4k video thanks to the new graphics card intel build.
            its call the iris Plus graphic card.
            i tryed putting 4k video on youtube and it looks amazing.
            in addition you have a mechanic keybord but it have a catch, this machanic keybord is
            completly quite and fells so premium when you type it.
            and the best part, it have led light!!!
            Another benefit this laptop have is the fingerprint sensor on the right.
            is so easy to add a finger, all you need to do is to rest you picked finger and rest it on the
            sensor a couple of times and there you go.
          </p>
          <p>
          The lenovo is running on windows 10 home, and i think the lpatop is working lovely with this
          new operation system.
          To sum up, I recommend to anyone who has some budget and wants a good computer to serve it for the next five years to buy this computer.
I was the owner of this blog and i see you in the next review, dont forget to share this article with you family and
